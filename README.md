# CampusQuoraProject

The project aimed to provide an IITG specific platform to exchange knowledge and ideas in the form of question and answer. Many of the students have a wide variety of doubts/questions regarding clubs, internships, placements, campus life, and more. These questions are much frequent and it is beneficial to have a campus-wide platform to exchange ideas. Keeping this in mind the project was started to allow people to ask questions, answer them and write comments to build upon discussions.
